# surfs_up
## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to gather and analyze temperature data in Oahu for the months of June and December 
to see whether the surf shop will be sustainable year round.
## Results

-The mean temperature of both months is warm and similar, with June being 74.94 and December being 71.04.\
-The max temperatures are also very similar, with June being 85 and December being 83.\
-The biggest difference between months is the minimum temperature. June's min temperature is 64, but December's is only 56.
## Summary
When analyzing the results of the temperature data, I came to the conclusion that this business will be well set up in Oahu.
The temperature data for June and December were very similar, 
meaning there should be plenty of good surfing and ice cream days throughout the year.
W. Avy should feel confident about their business being located here.
An additional query I would recommend would be one analyzing the precipitation in different months throughout the year in Oahu.
I would also recommend a query analyzing the winds around Oahu to try to get a greater sense of what its effect is
on the waves in Oahu.
